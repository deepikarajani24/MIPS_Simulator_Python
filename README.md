# MIPS_Simulator_Python
Designed an MIPS simulator using python and tkinter to simulate how instructions takes advantage of Instruction level parallelism and demonstrates how an instruction stalls in pipeline when it depends on results from other instruction.

Different types of assembly language instruction set are supported, and their simulation results are produced.
